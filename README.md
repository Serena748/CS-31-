# FILES TO BE UPLOADED BY JAN 1 

In Smallberg we trust.

In my first quarter at UCLA, I took CS 31: Introduction to Computer Science, a mandatory class for all first year computer science students. 

The class covered foundation concepts and principles of computer science; fundamental computer programming principles, methodologies, and techniques; and basic concepts of programming in general and the C++ language specifically, and not to mention, outstanding class grade curves: C- median? D mean?? "your score was in the top 99th percentile" ;) ??

With 7 projects spanning over 1500 lines of code, we covered control flow, functions, arrays, strings, pointers, structs and classes, constructors, and function overloading. Lots of pointers.
